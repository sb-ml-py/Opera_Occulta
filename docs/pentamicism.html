	<h3 style="text-align: center;">By Teacher Laghem Alkaran</h3>
	<br><br>
	
	<h2>Creation</h2>
			<p>
			First was <a href="reisolus.html" class="a">Reisolus</a> who created the worlds. 
			Second was Hell, the primordial foundation. 
			Third was the earth, the world of man, called Hamaraz. 
			Four pilars were erected upon the corners of the earth, <a href="four_winds.html" class="a">Borello, Faveza, Libernio, and Aphelia</a>.
			Heaven was the last, above the earth and borne upon the pilars.
			</p>
			<p>
			The old things, first resided in Hell. 
			They came to live upon the earth, but such was not their place. 
			Theirs was rock and fire, smoke and changing forms, while earth was for growing things, water, and the predictable cycle of seasons. 
			In accordance with Reisolus' design, Borello pushed back the rock, Libernio the fire, Faveza the smoke, and Aphelia the changing forms. 
			In this way was Hamaraz cleansed to become a suitable place for soulful life.
			Reisolus set Heaven, the masterwork, in motion as a guiding light for the creatures of the earth.
			Such was the start of time, and the dawn of mankind.
			</p>
			<p>
			Mankind was favored by Reisolus, and so gifts were given to them. 
			Borello gave the sense to understand creation. 
			Faveza gave the courage to defend creation.
			Libernio gave the freedom of choice.
			Aphelia gave the inspiration to create.
			Finally Reisolus gave mankind the duty to safeguard Hamaraz.
			</p>

	<h2>Life and Worship</h2>
			<h3>The Household</h3>
			<p>
			The four corners of the household are in the family as the four corners of the earth. 
			Like Reisolus, gods and worship form the center. 
			The father is like Borello, wise and reasoned. 
			The mother is like Faveza, steadfast and nurturing.
			Together they guide the household.
			The children are like Libernio and Aphelia, free and creative, unburdened by leadership.
			As they grow into adulthood, so too will they grow into duty.
			</p>
			<h3>Principles of Good Living</h3>
			<p>
			<ul>
			<li>Prayer should occur at the close of each day. This prayer should include thanks for the blessings of the day and pleadings for mercy for the sins of the day.</li>
			<li>Thanks and pleas should be directed to the appropriate god.</li>
			<li>You should not make rash choices, gamble, or ignore the advice of your elders for these are sins against Borello.</li>
			<li>You should not murder, steal, or lie for these are sins against Faveza.</li>
			<li>You should not tolerate slavery, idolize any but the gods, or deny your faith for these are sins against Libernio.</li>
			<li>You should not cause wanton destruction, harbor jealousy, or bear a grudge for these are sins against Aphelia.</li>
			<li>You should not be derelict in your duties nor shrink from the responsibilities put before you, for this is a sin against Reisolus.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

	<h2>Death and Thereafter</h2>
			<p>
			When you die, your soul will rest for a time, then will re-enter the world in the form of another. 
			As long as the body remains, the soul will rest. 
			Burning of the body will cause the soul to re-enter the world immediately. 
			Preservation of the body will prolong the rest. 
			It is the preserve of the individual or members of their family to choose whether to rest or return.
