	Long before the ages of man, giant lizards roamed Hamaraz. 
	Their reign was characterized by successive cataclysms. 
	In that time, just as the flora and fauna were chaotic, so too was the geology. 
	Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors, droughts, and monsoons were frequently seen on a catastrophic and global scale. 
	Many times the lizards reached their peak and many times again were they wiped from existence. 
	Yet, life recovers, and again they reigned, and again were destroyed. 
	Theirs was an existence characterized by the immeasurable expanse of time and by the doom that always hung over them. 
	Some say the remnants of these ancient lizards survive to this day in caverns deep beneath the ground.
