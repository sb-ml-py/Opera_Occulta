	<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
			The Cahochic people worship a variety of spirits. 
			These spirits are categorized by many means, but the simplest is by their relation towards people, namely the amiable and the contrary. 
			Amiable spirits are likely to serve when called upon, while contrary spirits are likely to ignore or even harm those who call on them. 
			Both shamans and laypeople routinely worship and call upon the spirits.
			The contrary spirits are considered too much for most laymen and will seldom be called upon except by shamans. 
			In addition to the spirits listed below, many laymen will call upon their ancestors or other spirits unique to their family. 
			Rituals typically involve mind-altering substances, a sacrifice of food or blood, and repeated invocations in song.
