	Shadoun is or was the king of demons. 
	Some say he was the first demon, others say he was just the greatest of them. 
	It is unclear whether he still reigns among the demons or whether his rule has been usurped by another. 
	Many say he cannot be killed, and therefore must still be king in Hell. 
	He can take any form but usually appears as a black dragon. 
	Other demons often take the form of dragons as a tribute to Shadoun. 
	Dragons do not appreciate this.

	<p>
	Many cultures see Shadoun and his demons as the enemies of mankind and of all living creatures. 
	Notable exceptions exist in Cahoche and Almawar. 
	In Cahoche Shadoun is worshipped as one among the many great spirits among the pagans.
	In that religion he is the patron of those who are tormented. 
	In small cults in Almawar Shadoun is worshipped as the opposing force to <a href="reisolus.html" class="a">Reisolus</a>, the destruction that balances creation.
